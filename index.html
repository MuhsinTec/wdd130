        <p>Hello! My name is Muhsin Namboobi and I am a software development student at BYU–Idaho. I am passionate about
            creating
            robust web and application solutions. This page serves as a live portfolio to document and share my journey,
            progress,
            and key projects throughout the semester. I am looking forward to sharpening my skills, building real-world
            projects,
            and learning more about the industry. I am excited to see what the future holds for me.</p>
